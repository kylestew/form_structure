## What I had to do

- Fix broken references in KiCad project
- Order PCB with some populated components
- Order remaining components (some were out of stock or overpriced so I adjusted, likely would need to adjust again)

## What I added

- programming header, didn't work, gave up

## Programming

- Programming was tricky, show what worked
- Fix broken code (missing?)

## It works!

- show working unit

## Next Steps

- Serial terminal for rapid instrument making
