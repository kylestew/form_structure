## Hello Canvas

I guess give this an ID
<Canvas />

And target the ID from the script here?
Can we pull multiple functions from the script and run them one at a time?
Or should we isolate them?
Script might have more functionality
<Script src="/canvas.js" strategy="lazyOnload" />

Can I also just load the JS and inject it as text?
