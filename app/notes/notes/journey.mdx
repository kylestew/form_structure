Computers used to be so exciting.

Below is an ongoing attempt to record my experience with early computing. I sometimes forget that I had a unique journey given the time that I started interacting with computers.

## Rendering & Display

-   [Color quantization](./quantization) - Reducing color depth for displaying images with limited colors.
-   [Dithering algorithms](./dithering) – Floyd-Steinberg, Bayer matrices, ordered dithering.
-   Scanline rendering – Simple technique for filling polygons or images line-by-line.
-   Blitting – Copying image buffers efficiently (used in games and early UIs).
-   Sprites and Tilemaps - Essentail in 2D game engines for memory and efficiency.
-   Halftone

## Image & Compression Algorithms

-   [JPEG](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XuRsUmFmAJ2lEuvaJp4W58M9FYUzW5hT?usp=drive_link) – DCT, quantization, zig-zag, Huffman coding.
-   GIF – LZW compression, palette limitations, transparency.
-   PNG – Lossless compression using DEFLATE, Paeth predictor, and alpha channel.
-   BMP – Simpler, raw representation, but worth comparing for how uncompressed formats work.
-   TIFF – A deep rabbit hole: optional compression, metadata, used in scanners and high-end imaging.
-   MPEG-1 – Compression via motion estimation, DCT, keyframes (used in Video CDs).
-   [Fractal Compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_compression#:~:text=An%20inherent%20feature%20of%20fractal,known%20as%20%22fractal%20scaling%22.)

## Color Spaces

-   YUV / YCbCr – Used in video compression.
-   Indexed color – Key for early image formats (GIF, PCX).
-   sRGB
-   CEILAB
-   https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/cosine-color-schemes?collection=@mbostock/color
-   https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/lab-and-rgb

## Random Number Generators (RNGs)

-   Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)
-   Mersenne Twister
-   Xorshift
-   PCG
-   Middle Square Method – A charmingly flawed early PRNG (not good, but historical).

## Algorithms & Math Fun

-   Bresenham’s line/circle algorithm – Low-level pixel plotting before antialiasing.
-   Flood fill – Used in MS Paint and old drawing programs.
-   Z-buffering (early 3D) – A key idea before GPUs could handle it in hardware.
-   Painter’s algorithm - Sort polygons back-to-front and draw them in that order. Simple and intuitive, but can fail with overlapping geometry.
-   Scanline polygon fill - Used to efficiently fill concave or complex polygons. A key step in early software rasterizers before GPUs.
-   Binary Space Partitioning (BSP trees) - Used heavily in DOOM and Quake to efficiently render indoor 3D spaces by splitting the world into convex regions.
-   Backface culling - Don’t render triangles whose normals face away from the camera. Greatly improves speed and clarity in 3D scenes.
-   Raycasting (2.5D) - Used in Wolfenstein 3D. Instead of full 3D, it shoots rays from the player’s view and finds wall hits on a 2D map, simulating depth.
-   Ray–box and ray–triangle intersection - Core to early 3D picking, selection, and collision detection. Often used in editors or ray-traced previews.
-   Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) line algorithm - A floating-point alternative to Bresenham; simpler to implement but slower. Useful for raycasting and grid traversal.
-   Barycentric coordinates - Used for point-in-triangle tests and interpolating vertex attributes (colors, UVs) inside a triangle.
-   A and Dijkstra’s algorithm\* - Used for AI pathfinding in grid-based games (e.g., tile-based RPGs and RTS games).
-   Marching squares / marching cubes - For contouring bitmap data (used in terrain, fluid, and volume visualization). Marching squares was popular in 2D terrain games.
-   Perlin noise / Value noise - Used for natural textures and terrain generation in early procedural graphics.
-   FFT / DCT

## Text & Data

-   [Run-Length Encoding (RLE)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ZN6VC7Q509JBAfMW9k4EHm7n4RYSUlP7?usp=sharing) – Simple but effective for fonts, bitmaps, and cursor icons.
-   Huffman Coding – Foundational to many compression schemes (ZIP, JPEG).
-   Dictionary compression – Like LZ77, LZ78, basis of ZIP and GIF.
-   ASCII / ANSI art – Not compression per se, but early ways of representing visual data in limited media.

## Display Technology

-   VGA
-   EGA
-   Mode 13h (320×200 256-color mode) – Used in DOS game graphics.
-   Text mode graphics – ANSI art, code page 437, “code graphics” via box-drawing characters.

## Systems / Storage / Misc

-   Filesystem structures – FAT16/FAT32 layout, cluster mapping.
-   Checksum algorithms – CRC32 (used in ZIP, PNG), Adler-32 (used in zlib).
-   Sound encoding – WAV PCM encoding, MIDI file structure, MP3 psychoacoustic compression.

## Programming & Dev Tools (Old-School)

-   Turbo Pascal / Turbo C – Blazingly fast compilers with tiny IDEs, great for learning.
-   Borland Delphi – Object Pascal IDE for Windows GUI apps, ahead of its time.
-   Borland C++
-   Visual Basic 6 – Let a generation of kids and sysadmins build real GUI apps.
-   WATCOM C++ – Used to build DOOM and other legendary games.
-   Assembly (MASM/TASM) – For those who dipped into the BIOS or demo scene.

## Early Games

-   Commander Keen
-   Wolfenstein
-   Doom
-   Prince of Persia – Rotoscoped animation marvel.
