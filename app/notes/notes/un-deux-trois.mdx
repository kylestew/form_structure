## Description

Un Deux Trois is a generative art piece that creates a mesmerizing grid of lines. The artwork divides the canvas into a 24x24 grid, where each cell contains either one, two, or three parallel lines. The number of lines increases gradually across the grid - cells in the first third contain a single line, the middle third holds two lines, and the final third features three parallel lines. Each line is placed at a random angle within its cell, creating an organic, flowing pattern that balances structure with randomness. The result is a dynamic composition that explores rhythm, density, and spatial relationships through simple geometric elements.
