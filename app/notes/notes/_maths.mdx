## Polynomials

Sum of a finite number of terms with coefficients and variables where ever variable is raised to a non-negative integer power. The degree of polynomial is the highest power of the variable.

$$
P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0
$$

## Linear Algebra

Lift ($L$) can be determined by the Lift Coefficient ($C_L$) using the following equation:

$$

L = \frac \rho v^2 S C_L


$$

Another classic equation:

$$

a^2 + b^2 = c^2


$$

Where:

-   $a$ = side of right triangle
-   $b$ = side of right triangle
-   $c$ = hypotenuse
    $$
